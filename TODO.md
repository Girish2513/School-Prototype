# Admin Page Implementation TODO

## Completed
- [x] Analyze existing code: ticker in Header.jsx, popup images in App.jsx
- [x] Create AdminPage.jsx component with forms for ticker texts and popup images
- [x] Create AdminPage.css for styling
- [x] Modify App.jsx: add state for tickerItems and popupImages with localStorage, add /admin routing, pass props
- [x] Modify Header.jsx: accept tickerItems as prop
- [x] Modify PopupBanner.jsx: ensure it accepts imageUrls as prop (already does)

## Completed
- [x] Test the admin page functionality

## New Requirements
- [x] Add file upload functionality for popup banner images (instead of URL inputs)
